## Azure DevOps Pipeline Templates

This repository contains templates used in CI/CD pipelines that deploy an internal profile building project for [nvisia](https://www.nvisia.com/).

Nvisia is a software consulting company (SaaS) based out of Chicago. The project is hosted by Azure Cloud Computing Services and managed by a Kubernetes cluster. The motivation behind this project is to facilitate the ease of marketing nvisia's consultants to potential clients by reducing the manual and often tedious modifications that need to be done on a regular basis to appeal to any particular client. Note that this project is still in development and unavailable to the public.
